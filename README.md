# digit-audio-classifier-llm
This project implements a spoken digit recognition system using Python, PyTorch, and Librosa. The model is trained on the Free Spoken Digit Dataset (FSDD) and can classify digits from audio files as well as from live microphone input. The repository includes scripts for:

Downloading and preprocessing audio data

Extracting MFCC features

Training a CNN model

Running inference on saved .wav files

Optional real-time microphone input inference

This repository demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for audio-based digit classification, with modular code and easy-to-follow instructions for setup and experimentation
